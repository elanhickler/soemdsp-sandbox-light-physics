# Progress — soemdsp-sandbox Bugfixes

Branch: `void/sandbox-bugfixes` (off `codex/restore-before-formula-visual`)
Base: commit `ed2533f Add Sabrina reverb WIP module`

## Agent Rules
- Do not ask questions unless truly blocked.
- Make reasonable assumptions and continue.
- Work on unfinished TODOs in order.
- Mark completed TODOs with [x].
- Add new bugs, ideas, or follow-up work as TODOs.
- Run smoke tests (`python scripts\smoke_test.py`) after each fix.
- Build native modules after editing `native_modules/*.cpp`.
- Do not run destructive commands, force pushes, production deploys, or database resets.
- When editing sandbox source, restore `public/presets/useruisettings.json` and `useruisettings.js` from commit `4639c84` before running smoke tests (the test's UI settings update contract writes them back dirty).

## Completed

- [x] **0b** — Fix stale smoke anchor: `patchNode.type === "canvas"` → capability-based check.
- [x] **A** — Patch serialization: add `graphConnections`, `codeScreen`, `windows` to `serializeNodeGraphPatch`. Round-trip verified.
- [x] **K** — Worklet stop session gate: add `sessionId`/`planSerial` guard to `stop` message, matching other message patterns.
- [x] **F** — Centralize unsupported-source gate: replace 45-type hardcoded whitelist with `nodeGraphModuleProducesOutputWithoutSignalInput(type)`. Derives no-input types automatically from module definitions.
- [x] **G** — Unify duplicate-edge policy: graph connections now silently dedupe (`.flatMap` + `return []`) like signal connections and modulations.
- [x] **H** — Share retired-type set: extract `nodeGraphRetiredNodeTypes` constant, UI settings uses same set.
- [x] **B** — Improve CLAP host disconnect error message: mentions under-construction state and `.cmd` launcher path.
- [x] **I** — Surface CLAP feedback as plan-time issue in `compileNodeGraphExecutionPlan`.
- [x] **J** — Log CLAP latency/tail errors via `console.warn` instead of silently degrading to zero.
- [x] **E** — Pad CLAP output buffer by one process chunk to absorb latency compensation shift, preventing trailing silence.
- [x] **O** — Document `/shutdown` route in CLAP host README.
- [x] **M** — Clean Sabrina native module: remove dead `modInc` assignment, raise sample rate cap from 48 kHz to 192 kHz. Wasm rebuilt (6695 bytes).
- [x] **C** — Remove dead rendered playback cursor code (`startNodeGraphRenderedPlaybackCursor`, `tickNodeGraphRenderedPlaybackCursor`).
- [x] **N** — Update stale doc file paths: `ADDING_HARDCODED_SANDBOX_MODULE.md` and `OSC_MODULE_NON_UI_REFERENCE.md` now reference correct files.
- [x] Smoke test passes (all steps green).

## Active TODO

- [ ] **Push branch** — `git push origin void/sandbox-bugfixes` so Codex can merge.
- [ ] **Merge with Codex** — Coordinate merge of `void/sandbox-bugfixes` into `codex/restore-before-formula-visual` (or master). Resolve any conflicts.
- [ ] **E audit (deferred)** — Full render-tail/latency audit for CLAP latency compensation. The buffer padding fix prevents trailing silence but a proper audit of the render pipeline is still needed.
- [ ] **L (deferred)** — Double normalization on `commitNodeGraphPatch` (known/intentional per Codex). Revisit if profiling shows cost.

## Backlog Ideas

- [ ] **D (DENIED as stated)** — Ellipsoid native module file-scope globals. Codex confirmed the current call pattern reads x/y/mono synchronously per-node, so no corruption today. Known future-risk for stateful native module templates.
- [ ] **Sabrina instance handles** — Add explicit handle model for multi-instance Sabrina reverb (currently uses a fixed pool of 2).
- [ ] **CLAP host UI** — Re-enable CLAP host connect/plugins/diagnostics buttons when the under-construction state is lifted.
- [ ] **Instance handle pattern** — Create a general native module instance handle pattern so future C++→wasm modules don't repeat the globals pattern.

## Blocked
- None.
